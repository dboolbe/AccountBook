Account Book
============

Simple Android account book application designed to maintain an up-to-date record of account balances, debit & credit transactions, and transfer between accounts.

NOTE: This project is being tested against an unlocked T.Mobile HTC MyTouch Android cellphone. I have yet to run this application on a different phone. Currently this application is used in my daily activities. I am modifying it to fit my needs. It is not a pretty application but it is functional.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/dboolbe/AccountBook/archive/master.zip

## Todo

1. Add Recurring Transactions
2. Add Recurring Transfers

### Bugs

1. Verify that deleted transactions are deleted from the database.
2. Verify that deleted transfers are deleted from the database.
3. Fix the account balance to update after a deletion without having to restart the application.
